# üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Holistic Health App

A unified, AI-powered health platform that brings together all of my mini wellness apps into one seamless experience. This app bridges mental health, gut health, skin health, sleep, stress, exercise, and nutrition to give users a complete picture of their wellbeing.

## üåü Features

### Nutrition & Symptom Tracker
Log meals, hydration, caffeine, and supplements. Automatically correlate with digestive flare-ups, skin reactions, and energy changes.

### Symptom Predictor (ML/AI)
Uses machine learning to forecast risks and flares based on lifestyle patterns (e.g., "low sleep + high caffeine = ‚Üë reflux risk").

### Sleep & Stress Tracker
Daily logs for sleep duration, quality, mood, and stress. Links these metrics to physical symptoms, flare-ups, and recovery.

### Exercise & Recovery Tracker
Track workouts, walks, yoga, or other activities. Analyze how movement improves digestion, skin clarity, mood, and overall recovery.

### Skin Health Module (SkinTrack+)
Upload or mark affected skin regions, track medication compliance, and monitor flare cycles. Optional body map for pinpoint logging.

### Gut Health Module (GastroGuard)
Rate and log GI symptoms with scales for pain, bloating, reflux, etc. Includes habit triggers and remedies, personalized to user history.

### Mind & Mood Module (MindMap)
Journaling, mood check-ins, and stress logs. Sentiment analysis provides deeper insights into emotional health trends.

### Personalized Remedy Recommender
Ranks remedies and coping strategies by effectiveness for each individual, learning from past outcomes.

### Wearable Integration (planned)
Future support for Fitbit, Apple Watch, Whoop, Aura, and Flo to pull in biometrics like heart rate, HRV, sleep cycles, and activity.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access the applications:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - AI API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
# Navigate to your main Health Helper directory
cd "C:\Users\JTerr\OneDrive\Programming Projects\Health Helper"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Backend (Python FastAPI)
```bash
# Navigate to Health Helper Enhanced
cd "Health Helper Enhanced"

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r Configuration/requirements.txt

# Start the AI API server
python Core\ System\HEALTH_AI_API_SERVER.txt
```

### First Time Setup

1. **Load Sample Data:** Click "Quick Start with Sample Data" in the app
2. **Explore Features:** Try logging a meal, symptom, or sleep entry
3. **View Analytics:** Check the Analytics page for AI insights and predictions
4. **Review Predictions:** See ML-powered risk assessments and recommendations

### Configuration

- **Database:** SQLite (default) - easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL
- **AI Models:** Pre-trained models included, retrain with your data
- **Storage:** Local by default, cloud-ready for production

## üß† Why It Matters

Health is multi-dimensional. By combining mental, physical, and behavioral data, this app creates a holistic health assistant that helps users understand:

- **What triggers their symptoms**
- **How lifestyle changes reduce flares** 
- **Which remedies actually work best for them**
